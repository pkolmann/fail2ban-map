# Fail2Ban Message receiver and mapper to GeoIp

I have started this project to collect the fail2ban IP adresses, that my services get hit by and map those onto a world map.

I use the GeoIP Database to lookup IP to the location.

The web directory is your entry point to view the data, the upload directory is used to upload data from the servers.
